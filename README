FIFOFO(1)                   General Commands Manual                  FIFOFO(1)

NAME
       fifofo - hold FIFO's open

SYNOPSIS
       fifofo FIFO

DESCRIPTION
       fifofo  stands for FIFO fopen. It's a simple tool that calls fopen on a
       FIFO and exits when the FIFO is deleted using inotify.

       This is useful for processes that are supposed to run  as  daemons  but
       accept  input from stdin to provide some kind of console functionality.
       Some people run these in screen or tmux sessions to retain the  console
       functionality,  but  lose the benefits of some kind of service supervi‐
       sor.  The obvious solution is to create a FIFO and  pipe  it  into  the
       process.   But  that has it's own problems.  The process that opens the
       FIFO for reading will hang until some other process opens the FIFO  for
       writing.   Not  useful  if  you  do  not need the console at all times.
       Also, if the last writer closes the FIFO, it will send EOF to the read‐
       ing process and it will most likely stop reading.  Which means you will
       never be able to disconnect your console.  Not very practical.

       This tool was written as a simple way to  combat  this  problem.   Just
       start  fifofo  with the filename of your FIFO as the first argument and
       fifofo will magically make everything work.
